## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project integrates various machine learning and computer vision techniques to improve women's safety:

1. **Person Detection**:  
   - **Technique**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)  
   - **Purpose**: To detect individuals in surveillance footage and identify scenarios where lone women are present or surrounded by men.

2. **Gender Detection**:  
   - **Technique**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) built with Keras  
   - **Purpose**: To classify detected persons as male or female, helping analyze gender ratios.

3. **Gesture Recognition**:  
   - **Technique**: Random Forest Classifier combined with MediaPipe  
   - **Purpose**: To recognize SOS gestures in real-time for emergency situations.

4. **Facial Expression Detection**:  
   - **Technique**: MediaPipe  
   - **Purpose**: To analyze emotions and detect potential threats based on facial expressions.

5. **Detection of Women Surrounded by Men**:  
   - **Purpose**: To identify situations where women are in potentially unsafe environments based on the gender ratio of nearby individuals.

6. **Emergency Alerts**:  
   - **Technique**: OpenCV and Telebot  
   - **Purpose**: To send immediate alerts to the nearest police station in case of emergencies.
